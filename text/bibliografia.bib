 abstract = {The role of recommendation algorithms in online user confinement is at the heart of a fast-growing literature. Recent empirical studies generally suggest that filter bubbles may principally be observed in the case of explicit recommendation (based on user-declared preferences) rather than implicit recommendation (based on user activity). We focus on {YouTube} which has become a major online content provider but where confinement has until now been little-studied in a systematic manner. We aim to contribute to the above literature by showing whether recommendation on {YouTube} exhibits phenomena typical of filter bubbles, tending to lower the diversity of consumed content. Starting from a diverse number of seed videos, we first describe the properties of the sets of suggested videos in order to design a sound exploration protocol able to capture latent recommendation graphs recursively induced by these suggestions. These graphs form the background of potential user navigations along non-personalized recommendations. From there, be it in topological, topical or temporal terms, we show that the landscape of what we call mean-field {YouTube} recommendations is often prone to confinement dynamics. Moreover, the most confined recommendation graphs i.e., potential bubbles, seem to be organized around sets of videos that garner the highest audience and thus plausibly viewing time.},

 abstract = {Social-media platforms have created new ways for citizens to stay informed and participate in public debates. However, to enable a healthy environment for information sharing, social deliberation, and opinion formation, citizens need to be exposed to sufficiently diverse viewpoints that challenge their assumptions, instead of being trapped inside filter bubbles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to maximize the diversity of exposure in a social network. We formulate the problem in the context of information propagation, as a task of recommending a small number of news articles to selected users. We take into account content and user leanings, and the probability of further sharing an article. Our model allows us to capture the balance between maximizing the spread of information and ensuring the exposure of users to diverse viewpoints. The resulting problem can be cast as maximizing a monotone and submodular function subject to a matroid constraint on the allocation of articles to users. It is a challenging generalization of the influence-maximization problem. Yet, we are able to devise scalable approximation algorithms by introducing a novel extension to the notion of random reverse-reachable sets. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm on several real-world datasets.},

In reality, relationships fall everywhere along this spectrum, a topic social science has investigated for decades under the theme of tie strength. Our work bridges this gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we present a predictive model that maps social media data to tie strength. The model builds on a dataset of over 2,000 social media ties and performs quite well, distinguishing between strong and weak ties with over 85\% accuracy. We complement these quantitative findings with interviews that unpack the relationships we could not predict. The paper concludes by illustrating how modeling tie strength can improve social media design elements, including privacy controls, message routing, friend introductions and information prioritization.},

 abstract = {Humans make decisions based on the information they obtain from several major sources, among which the comments of others in Internet forums play an increasing role. Such forums cover a wide spectrum of topics and represent an essential tool in choosing the best products, manipulating views or optimizing our decisions regarding a number of aspects of our everyday life. However, many forums have extremely controversial topics and contents including those which radicalize the readers or spread information about dangerous products and ideas (e.g., drugs, weapons or aggressive ideologies). These just mentioned activities are taking place mainly on the so called “dark web” allowing the hiding of the identity of members using dark forums. We use network theoretical approaches to analyze the data we obtained by studying the connectivity features of the members and the threads within a wide selection of forums (including dark and semi-dark) and establish several characteristic behavioral patterns. Our findings reveal both common and rather different features in the two types of behavior. In particular, we show that the various distributions of quantities, like the activity of the commenters, the dynamics of the threads (defined using their lifetime) or the degree distributions corresponding to the three major types of forums we have investigated display characteristic deviations. This knowledge can be useful, for example, in identifying an activity typical for the dark web when it appears in the public web (since the public web can be accessed and used much more easily).},

Polarization as well as its effects on online social interactions have been extensively investigated. Still, the relation between group formation and personality traits remains unclear. A better understanding of the cognitive and psychological determinants of online social dynamics might help to design more efficient communication strategies and to challenge the digital misinformation threat. In this work, we focus on users commenting posts published by {US} Facebook pages supporting scientific and conspiracy-like narratives, and we classify the personality traits of those users according to their online behavior. We show that different and conflicting communities are populated by users showing similar psychological profiles, and that the dominant personality model is the same in both scientific and conspiracy echo chambers. Moreover, we observe that the permanence within echo chambers slightly shapes users' psychological profiles. Our results suggest that the presence of specific personality traits in individuals lead to their considerable involvement in supporting narratives inside virtual echo chambers.},

Based on these aggregated relationships, the system recommends items related to people and tags that are related to the user. Each recommended item is accompanied by an explanation that includes the people and tags that led to its recommendation, as well as their relationships with the user and the item. We evaluated our recommender system through an extensive user study. Results show a significantly better interest ratio for the tag-based recommender than for the people-based recommender, and an even better performance for a combined recommender. Tags applied on the user by other people are found to be highly effective in representing that user's topics of interest.},

 abstract = {The co-authorship network of scientists represents a prototype of complex evolving networks. In addition, it offers one of the most extensive database to date on social networks. By mapping the electronic database containing all relevant journals in mathematics and neuro-science for an 8-year period (1991–98), we infer the dynamic and the structural mechanisms that govern the evolution and topology of this complex system. Three complementary approaches allow us to obtain a detailed characterization. First, empirical measurements allow us to uncover the topological measures that characterize the network at a given moment, as well as the time evolution of these quantities. The results indicate that the network is scale-free, and that the network evolution is governed by preferential attachment, affecting both internal and external links. However, in contrast with most model predictions the average degree increases in time, and the node separation decreases. Second, we propose a simple model that captures the network's time evolution. In some limits the model can be solved analytically, predicting a two-regime scaling in agreement with the measurements. Third, numerical simulations are used to uncover the behavior of quantities that could not be predicted analytically. The combined numerical and analytical results underline the important role internal links play in determining the observed scaling behavior and network topology. The results and methodologies developed in the context of the co-authorship network could be useful for a systematic study of other complex evolving networks as well, such as the world wide web, Internet, or other social networks.},

Many popular online social networks such as Twitter, {LinkedIn}, and Facebook have become increasingly popular. In addition, a number of multimedia networks such as Flickr have also seen an increasing level of popularity in recent years. Many such social networks are extremely rich in content, and they typically contain a tremendous amount of content and linkage data which can be leveraged for analysis. The linkage data is essentially the graph structure of the social network and the communications between entities; whereas the content data contains the text, images and other multimedia data in the network. The richness of this network provides unprecedented opportunities for data analytics in the context of social networks. This book provides a data-centric view of online social networks; a topic which has been missing from much of the literature. This chapter provides an overview of the key topics in this field, and their coverage in this book.},

 abstract = {Recent empirical studies using large-scale data sets have validated the Granovetter hypothesis on the structure of the society in that there are strongly wired communities connected by weak ties. However, as interaction between individuals takes place in diverse contexts, these communities turn out to be overlapping. This implies that the society has a multilayered structure, where the layers represent the different contexts. To model this structure we begin with a single-layer weighted social network ({WSN}) model showing the Granovetterian structure. We find that when merging such {WSN} models, a sufficient amount of interlayer correlation is needed to maintain the relationship between topology and link weights, while these correlations destroy the enhancement in the community overlap due to multiple layers. To resolve this, we devise a geographic multilayer {WSN} model, where the indirect interlayer correlations due to the geographic constraints of individuals enhance the overlaps between the communities and, at the same time, the Granovetterian structure is preserved.},

Recent studies have shown that in spite of earlier visions about the “death of distance”, physical proximity is still a major factor in social tie formation and maintenance in virtual social networks. Yet, it is unclear, what are the characteristics of the distance dependence in online social networks. In order to explore this issue the complete network of the former major Hungarian online social network is analyzed. We find that the distance dependence is weaker for the online social network ties than what was found earlier for phone communication networks. For a further analysis we introduced a coarser granularity: We identified the settlements with the nodes of a network and assigned two kinds of weights to the links between them. When the weights are proportional to the number of contacts we observed weakly formed, but spatially based modules resemble to the borders of macro-regions, the highest level of regional administration in the country. If the weights are defined relative to an uncorrelated null model, the next level of administrative regions, counties are reflected.},

More recently, microblogging services (e.g., Twitter) and social network sites (e.g., Facebook) are believed to have the potential for increasing political participation. While Twitter is an ideal platform for users to spread not only information in general but also political opinions publicly through their networks, political institutions (e.g., politicians, political parties, political foundations, etc.) have also begun to use Facebook pages or groups for the purpose of entering into direct dialogs with citizens and encouraging more political discussions. Previous studies have shown that from the perspective of political institutions, there is an emerging need to continuously collect, monitor, analyze, summarize, and visualize politically relevant information from social media. These activities, which are subsumed under “social media analytics,” are considered difficult tasks due to a large numbers of different social media platforms as well as the large amount and complexity of information and data. Systematic tracking and analysis approaches along with appropriate scientific methods and techniques in political domain are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework for social media analytics in political context. More specifically, our framework summarizes most important politically relevant issues from the perspective of political institutions and corresponding methodologies from different scientific disciplines.},

 abstract = {It has been argued that the Internet and social media increase the number of available viewpoints, perspectives, ideas and opinions available, leading to a very diverse pool of information. However, critics have argued that algorithms used by search engines, social networking platforms and other large online intermediaries actually decrease information diversity by forming so-called “filter bubbles”. This may form a serious threat to our democracies. In response to this threat others have developed algorithms and digital tools to combat filter bubbles. This paper first provides examples of different software designs that try to break filter bubbles. Secondly, we show how norms required by two democracy models dominate the tools that are developed to fight the filter bubbles, while norms of other models are completely missing in the tools. The paper in conclusion argues that democracy itself is a contested concept and points to a variety of norms. Designers of diversity enhancing tools must thus be exposed to diverse conceptions of democracy.},

 abstract = {Algorithms for social influence maximization have been extensively studied for the purpose of strategically choosing an initial set of individuals in a social network from which information gets propagated. With many applications in advertisement, news spread, vaccination, and online trend-setting, this problem is a central one in understanding how information flows in a network of individuals. As human networks may encode historical biases, algorithms performing on them might capture and reproduce such biases when automating outcomes. In this work, we study the social influence maximization problem for the purpose of designing fair algorithms for diffusion, aiming to understand the effect of communities in the creation of disparate impact among network participants based on demographic attributes (gender, race etc). We propose a set of definitions and models for assessing the fairness-utility tradeoff in designing algorithms that maximize influence through a mathematical model of diffusion and an empirical analysis of a collected dataset from Instagram. Our work shows that being feature-aware can lead to more diverse outcomes in outreach and seed selection, as well as better efficiency, than being feature-blind.},

In recent years much progress has been made on ensuring fairness and reducing bias in standard machine learning settings. Yet, for network embedding, with applications in vulnerable domains ranging from social network analysis to recommender systems, current options remain limited both in number and performance. We thus propose {DeBayes}: a conceptually elegant Bayesian method that is capable of learning debiased embeddings by using a biased prior. Our experiments show that these representations can then be used to perform link prediction that is significantly more fair in terms of popular metrics such as demographic parity and equalized opportunity.},

These broadly reproduce the organic activity and the algorithmic filtering, respectively, of which the latter is now commonplace within social media or other online services. Surprisingly, we show this is all that is needed to create hegemony: a single viewpoint (or side) not only receives undue attention, but it also captures all the attention given to “top trending” items.},

 abstract = {Online social networks regularly offer users personalized, algorithmic suggestions of whom to connect to. Here we examine the aggregate effects of such recommendations on network structure, focusing on whether these recommendations increase the popularity of niche users or, conversely, those who are already popular. We investigate this issue by empirically and theoretically analyzing abrupt changes in Twitter's network structure around the mid-2010 introduction of its "Who to Follow" feature. We find that users across the popularity spectrum benefitted from the recommendations; however, the most popular users profited substantially more than average. We trace this "rich get richer" phenomenon to three intertwined factors. First, as is typical of network recommenders, the system relies on a "friend-of-friend"-style algorithm, which we show generally results in users being recommended proportional to their degree. Second, we find that the baseline growth rate of users is sublinear in degree. This mismatch between the recommender and the natural network dynamics thus alters the structural evolution of the network. Finally, we find that people are much more likely to respond positively to recommendations for popular users---perhaps because of their greater name recognition---further amplifying the cumulative advantage of well-known individuals.},

To study this imbalance in online equal opportunities, we leverage new Instagram data and offer for the first time an analysis that studies the effect of gender, homophily and growth dynamics under social recommendations. Our mathematical analysis demonstrates the existence of an algorithmic glass ceiling that exhibits all the properties of the metaphorical social barrier that hinders groups like women or people of color from attaining equal representation. What raises concern is that our proof shows that under fixed minority and homophily parameters the algorithmic effect is systematically larger than the glass ceiling generated by the spontaneous growth of social networks. We discuss ways to address this concern in future design.},

In this paper we focus on the news industry, where different algorithms are used to customize news offerings to increasingly specific audience preferences. While this personalization of news enables media organizations to be more receptive to their audience, it can be questioned whether current deployments of algorithmic news recommenders ({ANR}) live up to their emancipatory promise. Like in various other domains, people have little knowledge of what personal data is used and how such algorithmic curation comes about, let alone that they have any concrete ways to influence these data-driven processes. Instead of going down the intricate avenue of trying to make {ANR} more transparent, we explore in this article ways to give people more influence over the information news recommendation algorithms provide by thinking about and enabling possibilities to express voice. After differentiating four ideal typical modalities of expressing voice (alternation, awareness, adjustment and obfuscation) which are illustrated with currently existing empirical examples, we present and argue for algorithmic recommender personae as a way for people to take more control over the algorithms that curate people's news provision.This article is part of a theme issue ‘Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges’.},

We develop a general modeling framework to compare the predictions of the competing models. Using agent-based modeling, we formally demonstrate that the two theories make contradicting predictions and study the conditions of polarization. In conclusion, we call for empirical research on the competing assumptions of the two models, discussing major roadblocks and novel methods to overcome them.},

Using a dataset of 84,068 comments on 258 videos, we find that although comments on right-leaning videos are more heavily moderated from a correlational perspective, we find no evidence to support claims of political bias when using a causal model that controls for common confounders (e.g., hate speech). Additionally, we find that comments are more likely to be moderated if the video channel is ideologically extreme, if the video content is false, and if the comments were posted after a fact-check.},

Inspired by this gaping polarization and the extensive utilization of Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign, in this paper we take the first step in measuring polarization in social media and we attempt to predict individuals’ Twitter following behavior through analyzing ones’ everyday tweets, profile images and posted pictures. As such, we treat polarization as a classification problem and study to what extent Trump followers and Clinton followers on Twitter can be distinguished, which in turn serves as a metric of polarization in general. We apply {LSTM} to processing tweet features and we extract visual features using the {VGG} neural network. Integrating these two sets of features boosts the overall performance. We are able to achieve an accuracy of 69\%, suggesting that the high degree of polarization recorded in the literature has started to manifest itself in social media as well.},

In this work we initiate the study of the following question: {\textbackslash}beginquotation {\textbackslash}noindent Given n agents, each with its own initial opinion that reflects its core value on a topic, and an opinion dynamics model, what is the structure of a social network that minimizes {\textbackslash}em disagreementand {\textbackslash}em controversy simultaneously? {\textbackslash}endquotation {\textbackslash}noindent This question is central to recommender systems: should a recommender system prefer a link suggestion between two online users with similar mindsets in order to keep disagreement low, or between two users with different opinions in order to expose each to the others viewpoint of the world, and decrease overall levels of polarization and controversy? Such decisions have an important global effect on society {\textbackslash}citewilliams2007social. Our contributions include a mathematical formalization of this question as an optimization problem and an exact, time-efficient algorithm. We also prove that there always exists a graph with \$O(n/ε{\textasciicircum}2)\$ edges that is a \$(1+ε)\$ approximation to the optimum. Our formulation is an instance of optimization over {\textbackslash}em graph topologies, see also {\textbackslash}citeboyd2004fastest,daitch2009fitting,sun2006fastest. Furthermore, for a given graph, we show how to optimize the same objective over the agents» innate opinions in polynomial time. Finally, we perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on synthetic and real-world data that verify their value as mining tools to better understand the trade-off between of disagreement and polarization. We find that there is a lot of space to reduce both controversy and disagreement in real-world networks; for instance, on a Reddit network where users exchange comments on politics, our methods achieve a reduction in controversy and disagreement of the order \$6.2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}4\$.},

Identifying those topics is not only interesting from a societal point of view but also allows the filtering and aggregation of social media content for disseminating news stories. In this article, we perform a systematic methodological study of controversy detection by using the content and the network structure of social media. Unlike previous work, rather than studying controversy in a single hand-picked topic and using domain-specific knowledge, we take a general approach to study topics in any domain. Our approach to quantifying controversy is based on a graph-based three-stage pipeline, which involves (i) building a conversation graph about a topic, (ii) partitioning the conversation graph to identify potential sides of the controversy, and (iii) measuring the amount of controversy from characteristics of the graph. We perform an extensive comparison of controversy measures, different graph-building approaches, and data sources. We use both controversial and non-controversial topics on Twitter, as well as other external datasets. We find that our new random-walk-based measure outperforms existing ones in capturing the intuitive notion of controversy and show that content features are vastly less helpful in this task.},

Using a standard opinion formation model (Friedkin and Johnsen in J Math Soc 15(3–4):193–206, 1990), we define the polarization index, which, given a network and the opinions of the individuals in the network, it quantifies the polarization observed in the network. Our measure captures the tendency of opinions to concentrate in network communities, creating echo-chambers. Given this numeric measure of polarization, we then consider the problem of reducing polarization in the network by convincing individuals (e.g., through education, exposure to diverse viewpoints, or incentives) to adopt a more neutral stand towards controversial issues. We formally define the {ModerateInternal} and {ModerateExpressed} problems, and we prove that both our problems are {NP}-hard. By exploiting the linear-algebraic characteristics of the opinion formation model we design polynomial-time algorithms for both problems. Our experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate the validity of our metric, and the efficiency and the effectiveness of our algorithms in practice.},

 abstract = {Political polarization is traditionally analyzed through the ideological stances of groups and parties, but it also has a behavioral component that manifests in the interactions between individuals. We present an empirical analysis of the digital traces of politicians in politnetz.ch, a Swiss online platform focused on political activity, in which politicians interact by creating support links, comments, and likes. We analyze network polarization as the level of intra-party cohesion with respect to inter-party connectivity, finding that supports show a very strongly polarized structure with respect to party alignment. The analysis of this multiplex network shows that each layer of interaction contains relevant information, where comment groups follow topics related to Swiss politics. Our analysis reveals that polarization in the layer of likes evolves in time, increasing close to the federal elections of 2011. Furthermore, we analyze the internal social network of each party through metrics related to hierarchical structures, information efficiency, and social resilience. Our results suggest that the online social structure of a party is related to its ideology, and reveal that the degree of connectivity across two parties increases when they are close in the ideological space of a multi-party system.},

In reality, most people in a social network, except for a small fraction of the population, are initially either unaware of, or indifferent to, the disputed issue. To explore the consequences of such specific initial conditions, we study the polarization of social networks when conflicting ideas arise on two different seed nodes and then spread according to a majority rule. Using the configuration model and the stochastic block model as examples, we show that this framework leads to substantially different outcomes than those which employ random initial conditions. Moreover, the empirically observed splits in the karate and the dolphins' networks naturally come out of this paradigm. Our work thus suggests that the existing opinion dynamics models should be reevaluated to incorporate the initial condition dependence.},

We then propose an evaluation framework to verify the proposed quantitative measurement using a stance classification task. Based on the results, we further explore the extent of content polarization during the election period and how it changed across time, geography, and different types of users.

I test those implications using cross-national and longitudinal survey data. My results confirm that polarization correlates with individual partisanship across space and time. Citizens in polarized systems also perceive their parties to be more polarized. And perceiving party polarization makes people more likely to be partisan. That relationship appears to be causal: using a long-term panel survey from the United States, I find that citizens become more partisan as they perceive polarization increasing.},

 abstract = {We study a tractable opinion dynamics model that generates long-run disagreements and persistent opinion fluctuations. Our model involves an inhomogeneous stochastic gossip process of continuous opinion dynamics in a society consisting of two types of agents: (1) regular agents who update their beliefs according to information that they receive from their social neighbors and (2) stubborn agents who never update their opinions and might represent leaders, political parties, or media sources attempting to influence the beliefs in the rest of the society. When the society contains stubborn agents with different opinions, the belief dynamics never lead to a consensus (among the regular agents). Instead, beliefs in the society fail to converge almost surely, the belief profile keeps on fluctuating in an ergodic fashion, and it converges in law to a nondegenerate random vector.The structure of the graph describing the social network and the location of the stubborn agents within it shape the opinion dynamics. The expected belief vector is proved to evolve according to an ordinary differential equation coinciding with the Kolmogorov backward equation of a continuous-time Markov chain on the graph with absorbing states corresponding to the stubborn agents, and hence to converge to a harmonic vector, with every regular agent's value being the weighted average of its neighbors' values, and boundary conditions corresponding to the stubborn agents' beliefs. Expected cross products of the agents' beliefs allow for a similar characterization in terms of coupled Markov chains on the graph describing the social network.We prove that, in large-scale societies, which are highly fluid, meaning that the product of the mixing time of the Markov chain on the graph describing the social network and the relative size of the linkages to stubborn agents vanishes as the population size grows large, a condition of homogeneous influence emerges, whereby the stationary beliefs' marginal distributions of most of the regular agents have approximately equal first and second moments.},

Models using these assumptions are called bounded confidence models ({BCM}) as they assume a tolerance threshold after which interaction is unlikely. They are known to produce one or more clusters, depending on the size of the bound, with more than one cluster being possible only in the deterministic case. Introducing noise, as is likely to happen in a stochastic world, causes {BCM} to produce consensus which leaves us with the open problem of explaining the emergence and sustainance of opinion clusters and polarisation. We investigate the role of heterogeneous priors in opinion formation, introduce the concept of opinion copulas, argue that it is well supported by findings in Social Psychology and use it to show that the stochastic {BCM} does indeed produce opinion clustering without the need for extra assumptions.},

In this paper, we study the problem of quantifying and inferring the political leaning of Twitter users. We formulate political leaning inference as a convex optimization problem that incorporates two ideas: (a) users are consistent in their actions of tweeting and retweeting about political issues, and (b) similar users tend to be retweeted by similar audience. We then apply our inference technique to 119 million election-related tweets collected in seven months during the 2012 U.S. presidential election campaign. On a set of frequently retweeted sources, our technique achieves 94 percent accuracy and high rank correlation as compared with manually created labels. By studying the political leaning of 1,000 frequently retweeted sources, 232,000 ordinary users who retweeted them, and the hashtags used by these sources, our quantitative study sheds light on the political demographics of the Twitter population, and the temporal dynamics of political polarization as events unfold.},

Furthermore, the wide availability of content on the web fosters the aggregation of likeminded people where debates tend to enforce group polarization. Such a configuration might alter the public debate and thus the formation of the public opinion. In this paper we provide a mathematical model to study online social debates and the related polarization dynamics. We assume the basic updating rule of the Bounded Confidence Model ({BCM}) and we develop two variations a) the Rewire with Bounded Confidence Model ({RBCM}), in which discordant links are broken until convergence is reached; and b) the Unbounded Confidence Model, under which the interaction among discordant pairs of users is allowed even with a negative feedback, either with the rewiring step ({RUCM}) or without it ({UCM}). From numerical simulations we find that the new models ({UCM} and {RUCM}), unlike the {BCM}, are able to explain the coexistence of two stable final opinions, often observed in reality. Lastly, we present a mean field approximation of the newly introduced models.},

Here we quantitatively measure this kind of social bias at the collective level by mining a massive datasets of web clicks. Our analysis shows that collectively, people access information from a significantly narrower spectrum of sources through social media and email, compared to a search baseline. The significance of this finding for individual exposure is revealed by investigating the relationship between the diversity of information sources experienced by users at both the collective and individual levels in two datasets where individual users can be analyzed—Twitter posts and search logs. There is a strong correlation between collective and individual diversity, supporting the notion that when we use social media we find ourselves inside “social bubbles.” Our results could lead to a deeper understanding of how technology biases our exposure to new information.},

 abstract = {In this study we investigate how social media shape the networked public sphere and facilitate communication between communities with different political orientations. We examine two networks of political communication on Twitter, comprised of more than 250,000 tweets from the six weeks leading up to the 2010 U.S. congressional midterm elections. Using a combination of network clustering algorithms and manually-annotated data we demonstrate that the network of political retweets exhibits a highly segregated partisan structure, with extremely limited connectivity between left- and right-leaning users. Surprisingly this is not the case for the user-to-user mention network, which is dominated by a single politically heterogeneous cluster of users in which ideologically-opposed individuals interact at a much higher rate compared to the network of retweets. To explain the distinct topologies of the retweet and mention networks we conjecture that politically motivated individuals provoke interaction by injecting partisan content into information streams whose primary audience consists of ideologically-opposed users. We conclude with statistical evidence in support of this hypothesis.},

Understanding and quantifying polarization is a longterm challenge to researchers from several areas, also being a key information for tasks such as opinion analysis. In this paper, we perform a systematic comparison between social networks that arise from both polarized and non-polarized contexts. This comparison shows that the traditional polarization metric – modularity – is not a direct measure of antagonism between groups, since non-polarized networks may be also divided into fairly modular communities. To bridge this conceptual gap, we propose a novel polarization metric based on the analysis of the boundary of a pair of (potentially polarized) communities, which better captures the notions of antagonism and polarization. We then characterize polarized and non-polarized social networks according to the concentration of high-degree nodes in the boundary of communities, and found that polarized networks tend to exhibit low concentration of popular nodes along the boundary. To demonstrate the usefulness of our polarization measures, we analyze opinions expressed on Twitter on the gun control issue in the United States, and conclude that our novel metrics help making sense of opinions expressed on online media.},

We study how agents of each category and the population size can affect opinion dynamics. It is observed that the number of final opinion clusters is dominated by the closed-minded agents; open-minded agents cannot contribute to forming opinion consensus and the existence of open-minded agents may diversify the final opinions instead; for the fixed population size and proportion of closed-minded agents, the relative size of the largest final opinion cluster varies along concave-parabola-like curve as the proportion of open-minded agents increases, and there is a tipping point when the number of open-minded agents is almost equal to that of moderate-minded agents; for the fixed proportion of the three categories in the population, as the population size becomes larger, the number of final opinion clusters will reach a plateau.

This is typically performed in order to maximise platform usage. As a side effect, this introduces an algorithmic bias that is believed to enhance fragmentation and polarization of the societal debate. To study this phenomenon, we modify the well-known continuous opinion dynamics model of bounded confidence in order to account for the algorithmic bias and investigate its consequences. In the simplest version of the original model the pairs of discussion participants are chosen at random and their opinions get closer to each other if they are within a fixed tolerance level. We modify the selection rule of the discussion partners: there is an enhanced probability to choose individuals whose opinions are already close to each other, thus mimicking the behavior of online media which suggest interaction with similar peers. As a result we observe: a) an increased tendency towards opinion fragmentation, which emerges also in conditions where the original model would predict consensus, b) increased polarisation of opinions and c) a dramatic slowing down of the speed at which the convergence at the asymptotic state is reached, which makes the system highly unstable. Fragmentation and polarization are augmented by a fragmented initial population.},

All the agents are assumed to have heterogeneous confidence levels. Then the impacts of the opinion leaders and the environmental noises on the final opinions of the opinion followers are analyzed.

The researchers working on it come from disciplines such as physics, mathematics, computer science, social psychology and philosophy.In these models agents hold continuous opinions which they can gradually adjust if they hear the opinions of others. The idea of bounded confidence is that agents only interact if they are close in opinion to each other. Usually, the models are analyzed with agent-based simulations in a Monte Carlo style, but they can also be reformulated on the agent's density in the opinion space in a master equation style. The contribution of this survey is fourfold. First, it will present the agent-based and density-based modeling frameworks including the cases of multidimensional opinions and heterogeneous bounds of confidence. Second, it will give the bifurcation diagrams of cluster configuration in the homogeneous model with uniformly distributed initial opinions. Third, it will review the several extensions and the evolving phenomena which have been studied so far, and fourth it will state some open questions.},

 abstract = {The formation of opinions in a large population is governed by endogenous (interactions with peers) and exogenous (influence of media) factors. In the analysis of opinion evolution in a large population, decision making rules are often approximated with non-Bayesian “rule of thumb” methods. Adopting a non-Bayesian averaging rule, this paper focuses on an Eulerian bounded-confidence model of opinion dynamics and studies the information assimilation process resulting from exogenous inputs.  In this model, a population is distributed over an opinion set, and each individual updates its opinion via (i) opinions of the population inside the individual's confidence range and (ii) the information from an exogenous input in that range.  First, we establish various mathematical properties of this system's dynamics with time-varying inputs.  Second, for the case of no exogenous input, we prove the convergence of the population's distribution to a sum of Dirac delta distributions.  We further derive a simple sufficient condition for opinion consensus under the influence of a time-varying input.  Third, regarding information assimilation, we define the attracted population of a constant input.  For a weighted Dirac delta input and for uniformly distributed initial population, we establish an upper bound on the attracted population valid under some technical assumptions. This upper bound is an increasing function of the population's confidence bound and a decreasing function of the input's measure (i.e., the integral of input's distribution over the opinion space). Fourth, for a normally distributed input with truncated support, we conjecture that the attracted population is approximately an increasing affine function of the population's confidence bound and of the input's standard deviation; we illustrate this conjecture numerically.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems have been constantly refined to improve the accuracy of rating prediction and ranking generation. However, when a recommender system is too accurate in predicting the users’ interests, negative impacts can arise. One of the most critical is the filter bubbles creation, a situation where a user receives less content diversity. In the news domain, such effect is critical once they are ways of opinion formation. In this paper, we aim to assess the role that a specific set of recommender algorithms has in the creation of filter bubbles and if diversification approaches can decrease such effect. We also verify the effects of such an environment in the users’ exposition and interaction to fake news in the Brazilian presidential election of 2018. To perform such a study, we developed a prototype that recommends news stories and presents these recommendations in a feed. To measure the filter bubble, we introduce a new metric based on the homogenization of a recommended items’ set. Our results show {KNN} item-based recommendation with the {MMR} diversification algorithm performs slightly better in putting the user in contact with less homogeneous content while presenting a lower index of likes in fake news.},

Online recommender systems - built on algorithms that attempt to predict which items users will most enjoy consuming - are one family of technologies that potentially suffers from this effect. Because recommender systems have become so prevalent, it is important to investigate their impact on users in these terms. This paper examines the longitudinal impacts of a collaborative filtering-based recommender system on users. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper to measure the filter bubble effect in terms of content diversity at the individual level. We contribute a novel metric to measure content diversity based on information encoded in user-generated tags, and we present a new set of methods to examine the temporal effect of recommender systems on the user experience. We do find that recommender systems expose users to a slightly narrowing set of items over time. However, we also see evidence that users who actually consume the items recommended to them experience lessened narrowing effects and rate items more positively.},

 abstract = {Echo chambers in online social networks, in which users prefer to interact only with ideologically-aligned peers, are believed to facilitate misinformation spreading and contribute to radicalize political discourse. In this paper, we gauge the effects of echo chambers in information spreading phenomena over political communication networks. Mining 12 million Twitter messages, we reconstruct a network in which users interchange opinions related to the impeachment of the former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. We define a continuous political leaning parameter, independent of the network’s structure, that allows to quantify the presence of echo chambers in the strongly connected component of the network. These are reflected in two well-separated communities of similar sizes with opposite views of the impeachment process. By means of simple spreading models, we show that the capability of users in propagating the content they produce, measured by the associated spreading capacity, strongly depends on their attitude. Users expressing pro-impeachment leanings are capable to transmit information, on average, to a larger audience than users expressing anti-impeachment leanings. Furthermore, the users’ spreading capacity is correlated to the diversity, in terms of political position, of the audience reached. Our method can be exploited to identify the presence of echo chambers and their effects across different contexts and shed light upon the mechanisms allowing to break echo chambers.},

 abstract = {Social media allows citizens, corporations, and authorities to create, post, and exchange information. The study of its dynamics will enable analysts to understand user activities and social group characteristics such as connectedness, geospatial distribution, and temporal behavior. In this context, social media bubbles can be defined as social groups that exhibit certain biases in social media. These biases strongly depend on the dimensions selected in the analysis, for example, topic affinity, credibility, sentiment, and geographic distribution. In this paper, we present {SocialOcean}, a visual analytics system that allows for the investigation of social media bubbles. There exists a large body of research in social sciences which identifies important dimensions of social media bubbles ({SMBs}). While such dimensions have been studied separately, and also some of them in combination, it is still an open question which dimensions play the most important role in defining {SMBs}. Since the concept of {SMBs} is fairly recent, there are many unknowns regarding their characterization. We investigate the thematic and spatiotemporal characteristics of {SMBs} and present a visual analytics system to address questions such as: What are the most important dimensions that characterize {SMBs}? and How {SMBs} embody in the presence of specific events that resonate with them? We illustrate our approach using three different real scenarios related to the single event of Boston Marathon Bombing, and political news about Global Warming. We perform an expert evaluation, analyze the experts' feedback, and present the lessons learned.},

 abstract = {The "filter bubble" is a term which refers to people getting encapsulated in streams of data such as news or social network updates that are personalized to their interests. While people need protection from information overload and maybe prefer to see content they feel familiar or agree with, there is the danger that important issues that should be of concern for everyone will get filtered away and people will lack exposure to different views, living in "echo-chambers", blissfully unaware of the reality. We have proposed a design of an interactive visualization, which provides the user of a social networking site with awareness of the personalization mechanism (the semantics and the source of the content that is filtered away), and with means to control the filtering mechanism. The visualization has been implemented in a peer-to-peer social network, called {MADMICA}, and we present here the results of a large scale lab study with 163 crowd-sourced participants. The results demonstrate that the visualization leads to increased users' awareness of the filter bubble, understandability of the filtering mechanism and to a feeling of control over their data stream.},

Yet, there is to date no substantial quantitative evidence of this alleged pipeline. To close this gap, we conduct a large-scale audit of user radicalization on {YouTube}. We analyze 330,925 videos posted on 349 channels, which we broadly classified into four types: Media, the Alt-lite, the Intellectual Dark Web (I.D.W.), and the Alt-right. According to the aforementioned radicalization hypothesis, channels in the I.D.W. and the Alt-lite serve as gateways to fringe far-right ideology, here represented by Alt-right channels. Processing 72M+ comments, we show that the three channel types indeed increasingly share the same user base; that users consistently migrate from milder to more extreme content; and that a large percentage of users who consume Alt-right content now consumed Alt-lite and I.D.W. content in the past. We also probe {YouTube}'s recommendation algorithm, looking at more than 2M video and channel recommendations between May/July 2019. We find that Alt-lite content is easily reachable from I.D.W. channels, while Alt-right videos are reachable only through channel recommendations. Overall, we paint a comprehensive picture of user radicalization on {YouTube}.},

However, when users experience a recommender system, it is dynamic, constantly evolving as new items and new users arrive. The dynamic properties of collaborative recommendation have become important as prediction algorithms based on the interactions of rating histories have been proposed, and as researchers seek to understand problems of robustness and maintenance in rating databases. This paper proposes a new evaluation method for the dynamic aspects of collaborative algorithms, the "temporal leave-one-out" approach, which can provide insight into both user-specific and system-level evolution of recommendation behavior. As a case study, the methodology is applied to the Influence Limiter algorithm [12], showing that its robustness to attack comes at a high accuracy cost.},

 abstract = {Machine learning provides fundamental tools both for scientific research and for the development of technologies with significant impact on society. It provides methods that facilitate the discovery of regularities in data and that give predictions without explicit knowledge of the rules governing a system. However, a price is paid for exploiting such flexibility: machine learning methods are typically black boxes where it is difficult to fully understand what the machine is doing or how it is operating. This poses constraints on the applicability and explainability of such methods. Our research aims to open the black box of recurrent neural networks, an important family of neural networks used for processing sequential data. We propose a novel methodology that provides a mechanistic interpretation of behaviour when solving a computational task. Our methodology uses mathematical constructs called excitable network attractors, which are invariant sets in phase space composed of stable attractors and excitable connections between them. As the behaviour of recurrent neural networks depends both on training and on inputs to the system, we introduce an algorithm to extract network attractors directly from the trajectory of a neural network while solving tasks. Simulations conducted on a controlled benchmark task confirm the relevance of these attractors for interpreting the behaviour of recurrent neural networks, at least for tasks that involve learning a finite number of stable states and transitions between them.},

Recommender Systems ({RSs}) provide a technology that helps users in ﬁnding relevant contents on internet. Revolutionary innovations in the ﬁeld of internet and their consequent effects on users have activated the research in the area of recommender systems. This paper presents issues related to the changing needs of user requirements as well as changes in the systems’ contents.

 abstract = {In Vector Space Model, Cosine is widely used to measure the similarity between two vectors. Its calculation is very efficient, especially for sparse vectors, as only the non-zero dimensions need to be considered. As a fundamental component, cosine similarity has been applied in solving different text mining problems, such as text classification, text summarization, information retrieval, question answering, and so on. Although it is popular, the cosine similarity does have some problems. Starting with a few synthetic samples, we demonstrate some problems of cosine similarity: it is overly biased by features of higher values and does not care much about how many features two vectors share. A distance weighted cosine similarity metric is thus proposed. Extensive experiments on text classification exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed metric.},

To the best of our knowledge, there are no known methods for this problem. In this paper, we present the first approach for estimating the selectivity of tf.idf based cosine similarity predicates.

 abstract = {Words have different meanings (i.e., senses) depending on the context. Disambiguating the correct sense is important and a challenging task for natural language processing. An intuitive way is to select the highest similarity between the context and sense definitions provided by a large lexical database of English, {WordNet}. In this database, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms interlinked through conceptual semantics and lexicon relations. Traditional unsupervised approaches compute similarity by counting overlapping words between the context and sense definitions which must match exactly. Similarity should compute based on how words are related rather than overlapping by representing the context and sense definitions on a vector space model and analyzing distributional semantic relationships among them using latent semantic analysis ({LSA}). When a corpus of text becomes more massive, {LSA} consumes much more memory and is not flexible to train a huge corpus of text. A word-embedding approach has an advantage in this issue. Word2vec is a popular word-embedding approach that represents words on a fix-sized vector space model through either the skip-gram or continuous bag-of-words ({CBOW}) model. Word2vec is also effectively capturing semantic and syntactic word similarities from a huge corpus of text better than {LSA}. Our method used Word2vec to construct a context sentence vector, and sense definition vectors then give each word sense a score using cosine similarity to compute the similarity between those sentence vectors. The sense definition also expanded with sense relations retrieved from {WordNet}. If the score is not higher than a specific threshold, the score will be combined with the probability of that sense distribution learned from a large sense-tagged corpus, {SEMCOR}. The possible answer senses can be obtained from high scores. Our method shows that the result (50.9\% or 48.7\% without the probability of sense distribution) is higher than the baselines (i.e., original, simplified, adapted and {LSA} Lesk) and outperforms many unsupervised systems participating in the {SENSEVAL}-3 English lexical sample task.},

And then, we trained and tested the detection model using Long Short Term Memory ({LSTM}) recurrent neural networks. Experimental results show that the proposed {XSS} detection model based on deep learning achieves a precision rate of 99.5\% and a recall rate of 97.9\% in real dataset, which means that the novel approach can effectively identify {XSS} attacks.},

 abstract = {Context
Cross-site scripting ({XSS}) is a security vulnerability that affects web applications. It occurs due to improper or lack of sanitization of user inputs. The security vulnerability caused many problems for users and server applications.
Objective
To conduct a systematic literature review on the studies done on {XSS} vulnerabilities and attacks.
Method
We followed the standard guidelines for systematic literature review as documented by Barbara Kitchenham and reviewed a total of 115 studies related to cross-site scripting from various journals and conference proceedings.
Results
Research on {XSS} is still very active with publications across many conference proceedings and journals. Attack prevention and vulnerability detection are the areas focused on by most of the studies. Dynamic analysis techniques form the majority among the solutions proposed by the various studies. The type of {XSS} addressed the most is reflected {XSS}.
Conclusion
{XSS} still remains a big problem for web applications, despite the bulk of solutions provided so far. There is no single solution that can effectively mitigate {XSS} attacks. More research is needed in the area of vulnerability removal from the source code of the applications before deployment.},

The demonstrative benchmark with other detection methods highlights the efficiency of {DOCA} when discovering community structures of large-scale networks. By using {DOCA} to analyze the community structures of real datasets, we find that overlapping communities occur naturally and quite frequently, especially for top largest communities. In addition, overlapped nodes tend to be active users who participate in multiple communities at the same time.

Many researchers have proposed methods, which only consider the network structure of social networks, for discovering dense regions in social networks. However, increasing media information in networks, such as images, videos, user tags, and comments, are observed with the development and application of Web 2.0. Abundant content information is available to provide a different view for community detection process. In this paper, we propose an overlapping community detection method, namely, latent Dirichlet allocation-based link partition ({LBLP}), which uses a graphical model and considers network structure and content information. Two feature integration strategies are proposed to combine the influence of network structure and content information on the network generation process. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks show that the {LBLP} method is effective, and content information is beneficial in mining community structure.},

Instead, the method learns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata depending on whether they contain useful information.

 abstract = {Across many scientific domains, there is a common need to automatically extract a simplified view or coarse-graining of how a complex system’s components interact. This general task is called community detection in networks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data. It is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by their ability to find so-called ground truth communities. This works well in synthetic networks with planted communities because these networks’ links are formed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no planted communities in real-world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to treat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground truth. We show that metadata are not the same as ground truth and that treating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We prove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a general No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there can be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks. However, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still have value, so a careful exploration of their relationship with network structure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by introducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship between metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We demonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and for multiple types of metadata and community structures.
Troubles with community detection in networks: No ground truth, no free lunch, and the complex coupling of metadata with structure.

Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m∼n and d∼logn, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(nlog2n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2×106 edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.},

 abstract = {Although the inference of global community structure in networks has recently become a topic of great interest in the physics community, all such algorithms require that the graph be completely known. Here, we define both a measure of local community structure and an algorithm that infers the hierarchy of communities that enclose a given vertex by exploring the graph one vertex at a time. This algorithm runs in time O(k2d) for general graphs when d is the mean degree and k is the number of vertices to be explored. For graphs where exploring a new vertex is time consuming, the running time is linear, O(k). We show that on computer-generated graphs the average behavior of this technique approximates that of algorithms that require global knowledge. As an application, we use this algorithm to extract meaningful local clustering information in the large recommender network of an online retailer.},

 abstract = {Many community detection algorithms have been developed to uncover the mesoscopic properties of complex networks. However how good an algorithm is, in terms of accuracy and computing time, remains still open. Testing algorithms on real-world network has certain restrictions which made their insights potentially biased: the networks are usually small, and the underlying communities are not defined objectively. In this study, we employ the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark graph to test eight state-of-the-art algorithms. We quantify the accuracy using complementary measures and algorithms’ computing time. Based on simple network properties and the aforementioned results, we provide guidelines that help to choose the most adequate community detection algorithm for a given network. Moreover, these rules allow uncovering limitations in the use of specific algorithms given macroscopic network properties. Our contribution is threefold: firstly, we provide actual techniques to determine which is the most suited algorithm in most circumstances based on observable properties of the network under consideration. Secondly, we use the mixing parameter as an easily measurable indicator of finding the ranges of reliability of the different algorithms. Finally, we study the dependency with network size focusing on both the algorithm’s predicting power and the effective computing time.},

 doi = {10.1109/TCYB.2014.2305974},
 abstract = {Various types of social relationships, such as friends and foes, can be represented as signed social networks ({SNs}) that contain both positive and negative links. Although many community detection ({CD}) algorithms have been proposed, most of them were designed primarily for networks containing only positive links. Thus, it is important to design {CD} algorithms which can handle large-scale {SNs}. To this purpose, we first extend the original similarity to the signed similarity based on the social balance theory. Then, based on the signed similarity and the natural contradiction between positive and negative links, two objective functions are designed to model the problem of detecting communities in {SNs} as a multiobjective problem. Afterward, we propose a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, called {MEAsSN}. In {MEAs}-{SN}, to overcome the defects of direct and indirect representations for communities, a direct and indirect combined representation is designed. Attributing to this representation, {MEAs}-{SN} can switch between different representations during the evolutionary process. As a result, {MEAs}-{SN} can benefit from both representations. Moreover, owing to this representation, {MEAs}-{SN} can also detect overlapping communities directly. In the experiments, both benchmark problems and large-scale synthetic networks generated by various parameter settings are used to validate the performance of {MEAs}-{SN}. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficacy of {MEAs}-{SN} on networks with 1000, 5000, and 10000 nodes and also in various noisy situations. A thorough comparison is also made between {MEAs}-{SN} and three existing algorithms, and the results show that {MEAs}-{SN} outperforms other algorithms.},

 abstract = {Although a great deal of attention has been paid to how conspiracy theories circulate on social media, and the deleterious effect that they, and their factual counterpart conspiracies, have on political institutions, there has been little computational work done on describing their narrative structures. Predicating our work on narrative theory, we present an automated pipeline for the discovery and description of the generative narrative frameworks of conspiracy theories that circulate on social media, and actual conspiracies reported in the news media. We base this work on two separate comprehensive repositories of blog posts and news articles describing the well-known conspiracy theory Pizzagate from 2016, and the New Jersey political conspiracy Bridgegate from 2013. Inspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a graphical generative machine learning model where nodes represent actors/actants, and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific relationships. Posts and news items are viewed as samples of subgraphs of the hidden narrative framework network. The problem of reconstructing the underlying narrative structure is then posed as a latent model estimation problem. To derive the narrative frameworks in our target corpora, we automatically extract and aggregate the actants (people, places, objects) and their relationships from the posts and articles. We capture context specific actants and interactant relationships by developing a system of supernodes and subnodes. We use these to construct an actant-relationship network, which constitutes the underlying generative narrative framework for each of the corpora. We show how the Pizzagate framework relies on the conspiracy theorists’ interpretation of “hidden knowledge” to link otherwise unlinked domains of human interaction, and hypothesize that this multi-domain focus is an important feature of conspiracy theories. We contrast this to the single domain focus of an actual conspiracy. While Pizzagate relies on the alignment of multiple domains, Bridgegate remains firmly rooted in the single domain of New Jersey politics. We hypothesize that the narrative framework of a conspiracy theory might stabilize quickly in contrast to the narrative framework of an actual conspiracy, which might develop more slowly as revelations come to light. By highlighting the structural differences between the two narrative frameworks, our approach could be used by private and public analysts to help distinguish between conspiracy theories and conspiracies.},

Many algorithms have been proposed so far, but none of them has been subjected to strict tests to evaluate their performance. Most of the sporadic tests performed so far involved small networks with known community structure and/or artificial graphs with a simplified structure, which is very uncommon in real systems. Here we test several methods against a recently introduced class of benchmark graphs, with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)] and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 7327 (2007); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

 shorttitle = {Community Detection in General Stochastic Block models},
 abstract = {New phase transition phenomena have recently been discovered for the stochastic block model, for the special case of two non-overlapping symmetric communities. This gives raise in particular to new algorithmic challenges driven by the thresholds. This paper investigates whether a general phenomenon takes place for multiple communities, without imposing symmetry. In the general stochastic block model {SBM}(n,p,W), n vertices are split into k communities of relative size pii∈[k], and vertices in community i and j connect independently with probability Wiji,j∈[k]. This paper investigates the partial and exact recovery of communities in the general {SBM} (in the constant and logarithmic degree regimes), and uses the generality of the results to tackle overlapping communities. The contributions of the paper are: (i) an explicit characterization of the recovery threshold in the general {SBM} in terms of a new f-divergence function D+, which generalizes the Hellinger and Chernoff divergences, and which provides an operational meaning to a divergence function analog to the {KL}-divergence in the channel coding theorem, (ii) the development of an algorithm that recovers the communities all the way down to the optimal threshold and runs in quasi-linear time, showing that exact recovery has no information-theoretic to computational gap for multiple communities, (iii) the development of an efficient algorithm that detects communities in the constant degree regime with an explicit accuracy bound that can be made arbitrarily close to 1 when a prescribed signal-to-noise ratio [defined in terms of the spectrum of diag(p)W] tends to infinity.},

 abstract = {The modern science of networks has brought significant advances to our understanding of complex systems. One of the most relevant features of graphs representing real systems is community structure, or clustering, i.e. the organization of vertices in clusters, with many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges joining vertices of different clusters. Such clusters, or communities, can be considered as fairly independent compartments of a graph, playing a similar role like, e.g., the tissues or the organs in the human body. Detecting communities is of great importance in sociology, biology and computer science, disciplines where systems are often represented as graphs. This problem is very hard and not yet satisfactorily solved, despite the huge effort of a large interdisciplinary community of scientists working on it over the past few years. We will attempt a thorough exposition of the topic, from the definition of the main elements of the problem, to the presentation of most methods developed, with a special focus on techniques designed by statistical physicists, from the discussion of crucial issues like the significance of clustering and how methods should be tested and compared against each other, to the description of applications to real networks.},

We show that traditional community detection methods fail to find the metadata groups in many large networks. Our results show that there is a marked separation between structural communities and metadata groups, in line with recent findings.

Community detection constitutes a significant tool for the analysis of complex networks by enabling the study of mesoscopic structures that are often associated with organizational and functional characteristics of the underlying networks. Community detection has proven to be valuable in a series of domains, e.g. biology, social sciences, bibliometrics. However, despite the unprecedented scale, complexity and the dynamic nature of the networks derived from Social Media data, there has only been limited discussion of community detection in this context. More specifically, there is hardly any discussion on the performance characteristics of community detection methods as well as the exploitation of their results in the context of real-world web mining and information retrieval scenarios. To this end, this survey first frames the concept of community and the problem of community detection in the context of Social Media, and provides a compact classification of existing algorithms based on their methodological principles. The survey places special emphasis on the performance of existing methods in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements. It presents both a theoretical and an experimental comparative discussion of several popular methods. In addition, it discusses the possibility for incremental application of the methods and proposes five strategies for scaling community detection to real-world networks of huge scales. Finally, the survey deals with the interpretation and exploitation of community detection results in the context of intelligent web applications and services.},

In this work we solve the positive part of the conjecture. To that end we introduce a modified adjacency matrix B which counts self-avoiding paths of a given length ℓ between pairs of nodes. We then prove that for logarithmic length ℓ, the leading eigenvectors of this modified matrix provide a non-trivial reconstruction of the underlying structure, thereby settling the conjecture. A key step in the proof consists in establishing a weak Ramanujan property of the constructed matrix B. Namely, the spectrum of B consists in two leading eigenvalues ρ(B), λ2 and n -- 2 eigenvalues of a lower order O(nε √ρ(B) for all ε 0, ρ(B) denoting B's spectral radius.},

Most community detection algorithms use the links between the nodes in order to determine the dense regions in the graph. These dense regions are the communities of social media in the graph. Such methods are typically based purely on the linkage structure of the underlying social media network. However, in many recent applications, edge content is available in order to provide better supervision to the community detection process. Many natural representations of edges in social interactions such as shared images and videos, user tags and comments are naturally associated with content on the edges. While some work has been done on utilizing node content for community detection, the presence of edge content presents unprecedented opportunities and flexibility for the community detection process. We will show that such edge content can be leveraged in order to greatly improve the effectiveness of the community detection process in social media networks. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of our approach.},

Here we show that consensus clustering can be combined with any existing method in a self-consistent way, enhancing considerably both the stability and the accuracy of the resulting partitions. This framework is also particularly suitable to monitor the evolution of community structure in temporal networks. An application of consensus clustering to a large citation network of physics papers demonstrates its capability to keep track of the birth, death and diversification of topics.},

 abstract = {Consider a network where the nodes split into {KKK} different communities. The community labels for the nodes are unknown and it is of major interest to estimate them (i.e., community detection). Degree Corrected Block Model ({DCBM}) is a popular network model. How to detect communities with the {DCBM} is an interesting problem, where the main challenge lies in the degree heterogeneity. We propose a new approach to community detection which we call the Spectral Clustering On Ratios-of-Eigenvectors ({SCORE}). Compared to classical spectral methods, the main innovation is to use the entry-wise ratios between the first leading eigenvector and each of the other leading eigenvectors for clustering. Let {AAA} be the adjacency matrix of the network. We first obtain the {KKK} leading eigenvectors of {AAA}, say, η{\textasciicircum}1,…,η{\textasciicircum}Kη{\textasciicircum}1,…,η{\textasciicircum}K{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\_\{1\},{\textbackslash}ldots,{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\_\{K\}, and let R{\textasciicircum}R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}hat\{R\} be the n×(K−1)n×(K−1)n{\textbackslash}times(K-1) matrix such that R{\textasciicircum}(i,k)=η{\textasciicircum}k+1(i)/η{\textasciicircum}1(i)R{\textasciicircum}(i,k)=η{\textasciicircum}k+1(i)/η{\textasciicircum}1(i){\textbackslash}hat\{R\}(i,k)={\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\_\{k+1\}(i)/{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\_\{1\}(i), 1≤i≤n1≤i≤n1{\textbackslash}leq i{\textbackslash}leq n, 1≤k≤K−11≤k≤K−11{\textbackslash}leq k{\textbackslash}leq K-1. We then use R{\textasciicircum}R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}hat\{R\} for clustering by applying the kkk-means method. The central surprise is, the effect of degree heterogeneity is largely ancillary, and can be effectively removed by taking entry-wise ratios between η{\textasciicircum}k+1η{\textasciicircum}k+1{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\_\{k+1\} and η{\textasciicircum}1η{\textasciicircum}1{\textbackslash}hat\{{\textbackslash}eta\}\_\{1\}, 1≤k≤K−11≤k≤K−11{\textbackslash}leq k{\textbackslash}leq K-1. The method is successfully applied to the web blogs data and the karate club data, with error rates of 58/122258/122258/1222 and 1/341/341/34, respectively. These results are more satisfactory than those by the classical spectral methods. Additionally, compared to modularity methods, {SCORE} is easier to implement, computationally faster, and also has smaller error rates. We develop a theoretic framework where we show that under mild conditions, the {SCORE} stably yields consistent community detection. In the core of the analysis is the recent development on Random Matrix Theory ({RMT}), where the matrix-form Bernstein inequality is especially helpful.},

 abstract = {Community detection algorithms are used to uncover hidden properties of network. Existing methods of discovering community in online social network largely relies upon existing network topology for identifying community of users. With the immense of large number of users and multi type relationship between them, networks become larger and complex. Identifying user interest and based upon that identifying community of like minded users from such online social networks (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) becomes important for targeted advertising and friend recommendation. We propose a context aware community detection approach to identify users with similar topical interest. Initially topic modeling method is used to extract topic from textual content (e.g. messages) shared by user. Further users interested in similar topic are identified, relationship links between them is used to model network and finally community detection method is used to identify cluster of strongly connected users from the modeled network.},

 abstract = {Recent evidence points to the detrimental effects of algorithmic deployment on human datasets, as often times such algorithms mirror and exacerbate existing inequalities in the input data. This work focuses on understanding the disparate effects of algorithms on social inequality and building theory and applications for graph algorithms with ramifications in the way we learn information online and offline. We show that in the case of recommendation algorithms, the most common heuristics that learn connections for providing social recommendations exacerbate disparity between different communities in a bi-populated network by reinforcing certain patterns in the network, such as homophilic behavior. Similar results occur for content recommendation, where we show that minority viewpoints are being further diminished by algorithms that learn relational data and over-recommend a majority viewpoint. On the other hand, algorithms may leverage community affiliation to disperse information in a network in a more effective manner while being more equitable in terms of the demographics reached in certain conditions. For such studies, we find closed-form conditions of the results using graph theoretical models that replicate inequality in social networks and use them to develop a set of algorithms that use network statistics to diffuse information in a feature-aware way, effectively reaching more communities than the status quo heuristics that are blind to sensitive features. Through validation on real-world data, we show that such learning algorithms benefit from being feature-aware in learning relational data in order to mitigate bias.},

 abstract = {Social media and social networking sites have become a global pinboard for exposition and discussion of news, topics, and ideas, where social media users often update their opinions about a particular topic by learning from the opinions shared by their friends. In this context, can we learn a data-driven model of opinion dynamics that is able to accurately forecast opinions from users? In this paper, we introduce {SLANT}, a probabilistic modeling framework of opinion dynamics, which represents users opinions over time by means of marked jump diffusion stochastic differential equations, and allows for efficient model simulation and parameter estimation from historical fine grained event data. We then leverage our framework to derive a set of efficient predictive formulas for opinion forecasting and identify conditions under which opinions converge to a steady state. Experiments on data gathered from Twitter show that our model provides a good fit to the data and our formulas achieve more accurate forecasting than alternatives.},

 shorttitle = {Paths to Polarization},
 abstract = {Understanding the social conditions that tend to increase or decrease polarization is important for many reasons. We study a network-structured agent-based model of opinion dynamics, extending a model previously introduced by Flache and Macy (2011), who found that polarization appeared to increase with the introduction of long-range ties but decrease with the number of salient opinions, which they called the population’s “cultural complexity.” We find the following. First, polarization is strongly path dependent and sensitive to stochastic variation. Second, polarization depends strongly on the initial distribution of opinions in the population. In the absence of extremists, polarization may be mitigated. Third, noisy communication can drive a population toward more extreme opinions and even cause acute polarization. Finally, the apparent reduction in polarization under increased “cultural complexity” arises via a particular property of the polarization measurement, under which a population containing a wider diversity of extreme views is deemed less polarized. This work has implications for understanding the population dynamics of beliefs, opinions, and polarization as well as broader implications for the analysis of agent-based models of social phenomena.},

 abstract = {The role that {YouTube} and its behind-the-scenes recommendation algorithm plays in encouraging online radicalization has been suggested by both journalists and academics alike. This study directly quantifies these claims by examining the role that {YouTube}'s algorithm plays in suggesting radicalized content. After categorizing nearly 800 political channels, we were able to differentiate between political schemas in order to analyze the algorithm traffic flows out and between each group. After conducting a detailed analysis of recommendations received by each channel type, we refute the popular radicalization claims. To the contrary, these data suggest that {YouTube}'s recommendation algorithm actively discourages viewers from visiting radicalizing or extremist content. Instead, the algorithm is shown to favor mainstream media and cable news content over independent {YouTube} channels with slant towards left-leaning or politically neutral channels. Our study thus suggests that {YouTube}'s recommendation algorithm fails to promote inflammatory or radicalized content, as previously claimed by several outlets.},

 abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Misperceptions are a major problem in debates about health care reform and other controversial health issues.
{METHODS}: We conducted an experiment to determine if more aggressive media fact-checking could correct the false belief that the Affordable Care Act would create "death panels." Participants from an opt-in Internet panel were randomly assigned to either a control group in which they read an article on Sarah Palin's claims about "death panels" or an intervention group in which the article also contained corrective information refuting Palin.
{FINDINGS}: The correction reduced belief in death panels and strong opposition to the reform bill among those who view Palin unfavorably and those who view her favorably but have low political knowledge. However, it backfired among politically knowledgeable Palin supporters, who were more likely to believe in death panels and to strongly oppose reform if they received the correction.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results underscore the difficulty of reducing misperceptions about health care reform among individuals with the motivation and sophistication to reject corrective information.},

The present paper presents results from five experiments in which we enrolled more than 10,100 subjects and tested 52 issues of potential backfire. Across all experiments, we found no corrections capable of triggering backfire, despite testing precisely the kinds of polarized issues where backfire should be expected.

Social media platforms seem to be losing the battle against online hate19,20 and urgently need new insights. Here we show that the key to understanding the resilience of online hate lies in its global network-of-network dynamics. Interconnected hate clusters form global ‘hate highways’ that—assisted by collective online adaptations—cross social media platforms, sometimes using ‘back doors’ even after being banned, as well as jumping between countries, continents and languages. Our mathematical model predicts that policing within a single platform (such as Facebook) can make matters worse, and will eventually generate global ‘dark pools’ in which online hate will flourish. We observe the current hate network rapidly rewiring and self-repairing at the micro level when attacked, in a way that mimics the formation of covalent bonds in chemistry. This understanding enables us to propose a policy matrix that can help to defeat online hate, classified by the preferred (or legally allowed) granularity of the intervention and top-down versus bottom-up nature. We provide quantitative ' assessments for the effects of each intervention. This policy matrix also offers a tool for tackling a broader class of illicit online behaviours21,22 such as financial fraud.},

 abstract = {A large number of the most-subscribed {YouTube} channels target children of very young age. Hundreds of toddler-oriented channels on {YouTube} feature inoffensive, well produced, and educational videos. Unfortunately, inappropriate content that targets this demographic is also common. {YouTube}'s algorithmic recommendation system regrettably suggests inappropriate content because some of it mimics or is derived from otherwise appropriate content. Considering the risk for early childhood development, and an increasing trend in toddler's consumption of {YouTube} media, this is a worrisome problem. In this work, we build a classifier able to discern inappropriate content that targets toddlers on {YouTube} with 84.3\% accuracy, and leverage it to perform a first-of-its-kind, large-scale, quantitative characterization that reveals some of the risks of {YouTube} media consumption by young children. Our analysis reveals that {YouTube} is still plagued by such disturbing videos and its currently deployed counter-measures are ineffective in terms of detecting them in a timely manner. Alarmingly, using our classifier we show that young children are not only able, but likely to encounter disturbing videos when they randomly browse the platform starting from benign videos.},

Among other results, our analyses show that right-wing channels tend to (a) contain a higher degree of words from "negative'' semantic fields, (b) raise more topics related to war and terrorism, and (c) demonstrate more discriminatory bias against Muslims (in videos) and towards {LGBT} people (in comments).

 abstract = {Social media data has become crucial to the advancement of scientific understanding. However, even though it has become ubiquitous, just collecting large-scale social media data involves a high degree of engineering skill set and computational resources. In fact, research is often times gated by data engineering problems that must be overcome before analysis can proceed. This has resulted recognition of datasets as meaningful research contributions in and of themselves.Reddit, the so called “front page of the Internet,” in particular has been the subject of numerous scientific studies. Although Reddit is relatively open to data acquisition compared to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, the technical barriers to acquisition still remain. Thus, Reddit's millions of subreddits, hundreds of millions of users, and billions of comments are at the same time relatively accessible, but time consuming to collect and analyze systematically.In this paper, we present the Pushshift Reddit dataset. Pushshift is a social media data collection, analysis, and archiving platform that since 2015 has collected Reddit data and made it available to researchers. Pushshift's Reddit dataset is updated in real-time, and includes historical data back to Reddit's inception. In addition to monthly dumps, Pushshift provides computational tools to aid in searching, aggregating, and performing exploratory analysis on the entirety of the dataset. The Pushshift Reddit dataset makes it possible for social media researchers to reduce time spent in the data collection, cleaning, and storage phases of their projects.},

 abstract = {Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations are widely used for large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs. Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide \& Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide \& Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. We have also open-sourced our implementation in {TensorFlow}.},

 abstract = {Neural-based multi-task learning has been successfully used in many real-world large-scale applications such as recommendation systems. For example, in movie recommendations, beyond providing users movies which they tend to purchase and watch, the system might also optimize for users liking the movies afterwards. With multi-task learning, we aim to build a single model that learns these multiple goals and tasks simultaneously. However, the prediction quality of commonly used multi-task models is often sensitive to the relationships between tasks. It is therefore important to study the modeling tradeoffs between task-specific objectives and inter-task relationships. In this work, we propose a novel multi-task learning approach, Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts ({MMoE}), which explicitly learns to model task relationships from data. We adapt the Mixture-of-Experts ({MoE}) structure to multi-task learning by sharing the expert submodels across all tasks, while also having a gating network trained to optimize each task. To validate our approach on data with different levels of task relatedness, we first apply it to a synthetic dataset where we control the task relatedness. We show that the proposed approach performs better than baseline methods when the tasks are less related. We also show that the {MMoE} structure results in an additional trainability benefit, depending on different levels of randomness in the training data and model initialization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance improvements by {MMoE} on real tasks including a binary classification benchmark, and a large-scale content recommendation system at Google.},

 abstract = {Collaborative filtering is a popular technique to infer users' preferences on new content based on the collective information of all users preferences. Recommender systems then use this information to make personalized suggestions to users. When users accept these recommendations it creates a feedback loop in the recommender system, and these loops iteratively influence the collaborative filtering algorithm's predictions over time. We investigate whether it is possible to identify items affected by these feedback loops. We state sufficient assumptions to deconvolve the feedback loops while keeping the inverse solution tractable. We furthermore develop a metric to unravel the recommender system's influence on the entire user-item rating matrix. We use this metric on synthetic and real-world datasets to (1) identify the extent to which the recommender system affects the final rating matrix, (2) rank frequently recommended items, and (3) distinguish whether a user's rated item was recommended or an intrinsic preference. Our results indicate that it is possible to recover the ratings matrix of intrinsic user preferences using a single snapshot of the ratings matrix without any temporal information.},

 abstract = {Although it is understudied relative to other social media platforms, {YouTube} is arguably the largest and most engaging online media consumption platform in the world. Recently, {YouTube}'s outsize influence has sparked concerns that its recommendation algorithm systematically directs users to radical right-wing content. Here we investigate these concerns with large scale longitudinal data of individuals' browsing behavior spanning January 2016 through December 2019. Consistent with previous work, we find that political news content accounts for a relatively small fraction (11\%) of consumption on {YouTube}, and is dominated by mainstream and largely centrist sources. However, we also find evidence for a small but growing "echo chamber" of far-right content consumption. Users in this community show higher engagement and greater "stickiness" than users who consume any other category of content. Moreover, {YouTube} accounts for an increasing fraction of these users' overall online news consumption. Finally, while the size, intensity, and growth of this echo chamber present real concerns, we find no evidence that they are caused by {YouTube} recommendations. Rather, consumption of radical content on {YouTube} appears to reflect broader patterns of news consumption across the web. Our results emphasize the importance of measuring consumption directly rather than inferring it from recommendations.},

 abstract = {Conspiracy theories have flourished on social media, raising concerns that such content is fueling the spread of disinformation, supporting extremist ideologies, and in some cases, leading to violence. Under increased scrutiny and pressure from legislators and the public, {YouTube} announced efforts to change their recommendation algorithms so that the most egregious conspiracy videos are demoted and demonetized. To verify this claim, we have developed a classifier for automatically determining if a video is conspiratorial (e.g., the moon landing was faked, the pyramids of Giza were built by aliens, end of the world prophecies, etc.). We coupled this classifier with an emulation of {YouTube}'s watch-next algorithm on more than a thousand popular informational channels to obtain a year-long picture of the videos actively promoted by {YouTube}. We also obtained trends of the so-called filter-bubble effect for conspiracy theories.},

 abstract = {{YouTube} has been implicated in the transformation of users into extremists and conspiracy theorists. The alleged mechanism for this radicalizing process is {YouTube}’s recommender system, which is optimized to amplify and promote clips that users are likely to watch through to the end. {YouTube} optimizes for watch-through for economic reasons: people who watch a video through to the end are likely to then watch the next recommended video as well, which means that more advertisements can be served to them. This is a seemingly innocuous design choice, but it has a troubling side-effect. Critics of {YouTube} have alleged that the recommender system tends to recommend extremist content and conspiracy theories, as such videos are especially likely to capture and keep users’ attention. To date, the problem of radicalization via the {YouTube} recommender system has been a matter of speculation. The current study represents the first systematic, pre-registered attempt to establish whether and to what extent the recommender system tends to promote such content. We begin by contextualizing our study in the framework of technological seduction. Next, we explain our methodology. After that, we present our results, which are consistent with the radicalization hypothesis. Finally, we discuss our findings, as well as directions for future research and recommendations for users, industry, and policy-makers.},

 abstract = {Why do people believe blatantly inaccurate news headlines (“fake news”)? Do we use our reasoning abilities to convince ourselves that statements that align with our ideology are true, or does reasoning allow us to effectively differentiate fake from real regardless of political ideology? Here we test these competing accounts in two studies (total N = 3446 Mechanical Turk workers) by using the Cognitive Reflection Test ({CRT}) as a measure of the propensity to engage in analytical reasoning. We find that {CRT} performance is negatively correlated with the perceived accuracy of fake news, and positively correlated with the ability to discern fake news from real news – even for headlines that align with individuals’ political ideology. Moreover, overall discernment was actually better for ideologically aligned headlines than for misaligned headlines. Finally, a headline-level analysis finds that {CRT} is negatively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively implausible (primarily fake) headlines, and positively correlated with perceived accuracy of relatively plausible (primarily real) headlines. In contrast, the correlation between {CRT} and perceived accuracy is unrelated to how closely the headline aligns with the participant’s ideology. Thus, we conclude that analytic thinking is used to assess the plausibility of headlines, regardless of whether the stories are consistent or inconsistent with one’s political ideology. Our findings therefore suggest that susceptibility to fake news is driven more by lazy thinking than it is by partisan bias per se – a finding that opens potential avenues for fighting fake news.},

 abstract = {Modern technology has drastically changed the way we interact and consume information. For example, online social platforms allow for seamless communication exchanges at an unprecedented scale. However, we are still bounded by cognitive and temporal constraints. Our attention is limited and extremely valuable. Algorithmic personalisation has become a standard approach to tackle the information overload problem. As result, the exposure to our friends’ opinions and our perception about important issues might be distorted. However, the effects of algorithmic gatekeeping on our hyper-connected society are poorly understood. Here, we devise an opinion dynamics model where individuals are connected through a social network and adopt opinions as function of the view points they are exposed to. We apply various filtering algorithms that select the opinions shown to each user (i) at random (ii) considering time ordering or (iii) its current opinion. Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between such mechanisms and crucial features of real networks. We found that algorithmic filtering might influence opinions’ share and distributions, especially in case information is biased towards the current opinion of each user. These effects are reinforced in networks featuring topological and spatial correlations where echo chambers and polarisation emerge. Conversely, heterogeneity in connectivity patterns reduces such tendency. We consider also a scenario where one opinion, through nudging, is centrally pushed to all users. Interestingly, even minimal nudging is able to change the status quo moving it towards the desired view point. Our findings suggest that simple filtering algorithms might be powerful tools to regulate opinion dynamics taking place on social networks.},

 abstract = {A recommender system aims to provide users with personalized online product or service recommendations to handle the increasing online information overload problem and improve customer relationship management. Various recommender system techniques have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many sorts of recommender system software have been developed recently for a variety of applications. Researchers and managers recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, education, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world applications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender systems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping, e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recommendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as {CF}), recommender systems software (such as {BizSeeker}), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions. By providing a state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practical professionals in their understanding of developments in recommender system applications.},

 shorttitle = {The echo chamber is overstated},
 abstract = {In a high-choice media environment, there are fears that individuals will select media and content that reinforce their existing beliefs and lead to segregation based on interest and/or partisanship. This could lead to partisan echo chambers among those who are politically interested and could contribute to a growing gap in knowledge between those who are politically interested and those who are not. However, the high-choice environment also allows individuals, including those who are politically interested, to consume a wide variety of media, which could lead them to more diverse content and perspectives. This study examines the relationship between political interest as well as media diversity and being caught in an echo chamber (measured by five different variables). Using a nationally representative survey of adult internet users in the United Kingdom (N = 2000), we find that those who are interested in politics and those with diverse media diets tend to avoid echo chambers. This work challenges the impact of echo chambers and tempers fears of partisan segregation since only a small segment of the population are likely to find themselves in an echo chamber. We argue that single media studies and studies which use narrow definitions and measurements of being in an echo chamber are flawed because they do not test the theory in the realistic context of a multiple media environment.},

 shorttitle = {{YouNiverse}},
 abstract = {{YouTube} plays a key role in entertaining and informing people around the globe. However, studying the platform is difficult due to the lack of randomly sampled data and of systematic ways to query the platform's colossal catalog. In this paper, we present {YouNiverse}, a large collection of channel and video metadata from English-language {YouTube}. {YouNiverse} comprises metadata from over 136k channels and 72.9M videos published between May 2005 and October 2019, as well as channel-level time-series data with weekly subscriber and view counts. Leveraging channel ranks from socialblade.com, an online service that provides information about {YouTube}, we are able to assess and enhance the representativeness of the sample of channels. {YouNiverse}, publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4327607, will empower the community to do research with and about {YouTube}.},
